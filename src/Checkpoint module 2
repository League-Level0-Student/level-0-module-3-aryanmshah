Random Checkpoint
On paper, write code that does the following: 
1. Get a random whole number that is less than 1,000.
random randy = new Random();
int x= randy.nextInt(999);
2. Get another random whole number that is less than 900.
random randy = new Random();
int x= randy.nextInt(899);


3. Print: joptionpane.showmessagediologue(null,"163");
 joptionpane.showmessagediologue(null,"35");
          a) What happens when you add the numbers , e.g. 99 + 64 = 163 
          b) What happens when you subtract the numbers , e.g. 99 Â­ 64 = 35 
          
          
          
      
Relational Checkpoint
The user is going to make some cookies.
On paper, write code that does the following:
1. Ask the user how many cups of flour they have. If they have less than 2 cups, tell
them to go to the store to buy more.


string x=joptionpane.showinputdialougue("How many cups of flour do you have");
int i= Integer.parseInt(x)
if(x<2){
joptionpane.showmessagediologue(null,"Go to the store for more flour");
}




2. Now ask them how many people they are going to give cookies to. If they are going
to give cookies to more than 30 people, tell them they are going to have to bake two
batches of cookies! 
string x=joptionpane.showinputdialougue("How many cookies r u givin people??");
int i= Integer.parseInt(x)
if(x<=30){
joptionpane.showmessagediologue(null,"boy! u need two batches");
}


3. Finally, ask them how many batches of cookies they baked. If they baked 2 batches
of cookies, tell them they are lucky to have so many friends. 
string x=joptionpane.showinputdialougue("How many batches have u baked");
int i= Integer.parseInt(x)
if(x=2){
joptionpane.showmessagediologue(null,"you got so many friend.......Not!!!");
}
